## Description

#### _This is a tic tac toe game made in javascript and html_

## Specifications

* A player should know whether it's an X or an O and be able to report that (e.g. player.mark() could return "X" or "O").

* A space should know its coordinates and be able to be marked by a player (e.g., space.mark(player_X)).
* A space should be able to report who it's marked by (e.g. space.markedby() could return "X" or "O", or it could return a player object - player1 or player2).
* A board should create 9 spaces with the proper coordinates, and tell if there are three in a row marked by the same player. A board should be able to return a space by its coordinates (e.g., board.find(1, 2)).
